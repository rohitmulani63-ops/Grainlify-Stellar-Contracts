# Program Escrow Contract

A Soroban smart contract for managing program-level escrow funds for hackathons and grant programs. This contract handles prize pools, tracks balances, and enables automated batch payouts to multiple contributors.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for this contract is available in the [`docs/`](../docs/index.md) directory:

- [Reentrancy Guard](../docs/program-escrow/REENTRANCY_GUARD_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- [Analytics Events](../docs/program-escrow/ANALYTICS_EVENTS.md)
- [Implementation Summary](../docs/program-escrow/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

## Features

- **Program Initialization**: Create a new escrow program with authorized payout key
- **Fund Locking**: Lock funds into the escrow (tracks total and remaining balance)
- **Single Payout**: Transfer funds to a single recipient
- **Batch Payout**: Transfer funds to multiple recipients in a single transaction
- **Release Schedules (Vesting)**: Queue timestamp-based releases and execute them when due
- **Balance Tracking**: Accurate tracking of total funds and remaining balance
- **Authorization**: Only authorized payout key can trigger payouts
- **Event Emission**: All operations emit events for off-chain tracking
- **Payout History**: Maintains a complete history of all payouts

## Contract Structure

### Storage

The contract stores a single `ProgramData` structure containing:
- `program_id`: Unique identifier for the program/hackathon
- `total_funds`: Total amount of funds locked
- `remaining_balance`: Current available balance
- `authorized_payout_key`: Address authorized to trigger payouts (backend)
- `payout_history`: Vector of all payout records
- `token_address`: Address of the token contract for transfers

### Functions

#### `init_program(program_id, authorized_payout_key, token_address)`

Initialize a new program escrow.

**Parameters:**
- `program_id`: String identifier for the program
- `authorized_payout_key`: Address that can trigger payouts
- `token_address`: Address of the token contract to use

**Returns:** `ProgramData`

**Events:** `ProgramInitialized`

#### `lock_program_funds(from, amount)`

Lock funds into the escrow. Updates both `total_funds` and `remaining_balance`.

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: i128 amount to lock (must be > 0)

**Returns:** Updated `ProgramData`

**Events:** `FundsLocked`

#### `single_payout(recipient, amount)`

Transfer funds to a single recipient. Requires authorization.

**Parameters:**
- `recipient`: Address of the recipient
- `amount`: i128 amount to transfer (must be > 0)

**Returns:** Updated `ProgramData`

**Events:** `Payout`

**Validation:**
- Only `authorized_payout_key` can call this function
- Amount must be > 0
- Sufficient balance must be available

#### `batch_payout(recipients, amounts)`

Transfer funds to multiple recipients in a single transaction. Requires authorization.

**Parameters:**
- `recipients`: Vec<Address> of recipient addresses
- `amounts`: Vec<i128> of amounts (must match recipients length)

**Returns:** Updated `ProgramData`

**Events:** `BatchPayout`

**Validation:**
- Only `authorized_payout_key` can call this function
- Recipients and amounts vectors must have same length
- All amounts must be > 0
- Total payout must not exceed remaining balance
- Cannot process empty batch

#### `get_program_info()`

View function to retrieve all program information.

**Returns:** `ProgramData`

#### `get_remaining_balance()`

View function to get the current remaining balance.

**Returns:** i128

#### `create_program_release_schedule(recipient, amount, release_timestamp)`

Create a time-based release that can be executed once the ledger timestamp reaches the schedule timestamp.

#### `trigger_program_releases()`

Execute all due release schedules where `ledger_timestamp >= release_timestamp`.

**Edge-case behavior validated in tests:**
- Exact boundary is accepted: release executes when `now == release_timestamp`
- Early execution is rejected: no release when `now < release_timestamp`
- Late execution is accepted: pending releases execute when `now >> release_timestamp`
- Overlapping schedules are supported: multiple due schedules execute in the same trigger call

## Events

### ProgramInitialized
Emitted when a program is initialized.
```
(ProgramInit, program_id, authorized_payout_key, token_address, total_funds)
```

### FundsLocked
Emitted when funds are locked into the escrow.
```
(FundsLocked, program_id, amount, remaining_balance)
```

### Payout
Emitted when a single payout is executed.
```
(Payout, program_id, recipient, amount, remaining_balance)
```

### BatchPayout
Emitted when a batch payout is executed.
```
(BatchPayout, program_id, recipient_count, total_amount, remaining_balance,
 gas_proxy_transfer_ops, gas_proxy_history_appends,
 gas_proxy_storage_reads, gas_proxy_storage_writes, gas_proxy_events_emitted)
```

Gas proxy fields are lightweight instrumentation for payout profiling. They track
high-level operation counts without adding per-recipient events, keeping event
footprint bounded for large batches.

## Batch Payout Gas and Footprint Notes

- `batch_payout()` emits exactly one contract-level batch event per call.
- Gas proxy counters are emitted in `BatchPayout`:
  - `gas_proxy_transfer_ops = recipient_count`
  - `gas_proxy_history_appends = recipient_count`
  - `gas_proxy_storage_reads = 1`
  - `gas_proxy_storage_writes = 1`
  - `gas_proxy_events_emitted = 1`
- Payout loop avoids indexed recipient/amount reads and iterates pairwise, reducing per-item overhead for large batches.

### Stress/Gas Validation

The test suite includes:
- `test_batch_payout_stress_large_batch_event_footprint_is_bounded`
- `test_batch_payout_gas_proxy_improves_vs_legacy_model_for_large_batch`
- `budget_profiling_batch_payout_scales_linearly_to_max_batch_size`
- `budget_profiling_single_payout_and_trigger_releases_stay_under_regression_ceiling`
- `budget_profiling_gas_proxy_fields_match_operation_counts`

These validate bounded event growth, improved proxy metrics for large batches,
and real Soroban `env.budget()` CPU/memory regression ceilings.

### Budget Profiling

Run the profiling guard with:

```bash
cargo test budget_profiling -- --nocapture
```

Current native testutils measurements, excluding setup/mint/init cost:

| Operation | Size | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `batch_payout` | 1 | 355,276 | 54,175 |
| `batch_payout` | 10 | 1,877,730 | 277,195 |
| `batch_payout` | 50 | 9,889,779 | 1,658,435 |
| `batch_payout` | 100 (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`) | 22,491,709 | 4,280,485 |
| `single_payout` | 1 | 345,503 | 53,351 |
| `trigger_program_releases` | 10 due schedules | 2,370,396 | 385,935 |

The regression test resets `env.budget()` immediately before each measured call,
then asserts CPU and memory stay below documented ceilings. The Soroban SDK notes
that native Rust test execution can underestimate WASM costs, so these numbers
are CI regression guards rather than mainnet fee quotes.

## Usage Flow

1. **Initialize Program**: Call `init_program()` with program ID, authorized key, and token address
2. **Lock Funds**: Call `lock_program_funds()` to deposit funds (can be called multiple times)
3. **Execute Payouts**: Call `single_payout()` or `batch_payout()` to distribute funds
4. **Monitor**: Use `get_program_info()` or `get_remaining_balance()` to check status

## Security Considerations

- Only the `authorized_payout_key` can trigger payouts
- Balance validation prevents over-spending
- All amounts must be positive
- Payout history is immutable and auditable
- Token transfers use the Soroban token contract standard

## Batch Payout Gas and Footprint Notes

- `batch_payout()` minimizes storage churn by mutating in-memory `ProgramData` and persisting once.
- Payout loop reuses batch invariants (`batch_len`, threshold, token client) to reduce repeated host work.
- Event footprint stays predictable:
  - Exactly one `BatchPay` and one `AggStats` contract event per batch call.
  - `LrgPay` events are threshold-gated and mathematically bounded by payout constraints.
- Gas-proxy tests for large batches live in `src/test.rs` and assert event-growth and footprint bounds.

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Building

Build the contract with:
```bash
soroban contract build
```

## Deployment

Deploy using Soroban CLI:
```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/program_escrow.wasm \
  --source <your-account> \
  --network <network>
```

## Integration with Backend

The backend should:
1. Initialize the contract with the backend's authorized key
2. Monitor events for program state changes
3. Call `batch_payout()` after computing final scores and verifying KYC
4. Track payout history for audit purposes

## Example

```rust
// Initialize
let program_data = contract.init_program(
    &env,
    String::from_str(&env, "stellar-hackathon-2024"),
    backend_address,
    token_address
);

// Lock funds (50,000 XLM in stroops)
contract.lock_program_funds(&env, &admin, &50_000_000_000);

// Batch payout to winners
let recipients = vec![&env, winner1, winner2, winner3];
let amounts = vec![&env, 20_000_000_000, 15_000_000_000, 10_000_000_000];
contract.batch_payout(&env, recipients, amounts);

// Check remaining balance
let balance = contract.get_remaining_balance(&env);
```
